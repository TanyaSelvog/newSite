I started volunteering for [Seattle Postgres](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-postgres/) and I really enjoy it. Last week was the first meetup where I helped out with set up, greeting people, and recording the presentation. It was really beneficial because I was able to meet people and network and I was actually able to talk about databases.
